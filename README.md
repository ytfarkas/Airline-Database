# Airline Database  
  
A web-based flight booking and management platform supporting airline operations across multiple user roles.

## Database Schema  
  
The system uses 13 interconnected tables organized into four modules:  
  
**Core Entities**: `Account`, `Airline_Company`, `Airport`, `Aircraft`  
  
**Flight Management**: `Flight_Schedule`, `Flight_Operating_Days`, `Flight_Avalibility`  
  
**Booking System**: `Bookings`, `Ticket`, `Waitlist`  
  
**Support System**: `Question`, `Answer`  
  
## User Roles  
  
Three role-based access levels defined in the `Account` table:  
  
| Role | Access Level | Home Page |  
|------|-------------|-----------|  
| **Administrator** | Full system access, user management, all reports | `adminHome.jsp` |  
| **Representative** | Booking operations, data maintenance, customer support | `repHome.jsp` |  
| **Customer** | Self-service flight search and booking management | `customerHome.jsp` |  


## Default test accounts (username/password):
- Customer: c / c
- Representative: r / r
- Administrator: a / a

## Application Entry Point
Access the system through login.jsp, which routes users to role-specific dashboards based on their account type.

## Data Model Highlights
Flight Instance Model
The system separates static flight schedules from dynamic flight instances:

- **Flight_Schedule**: Recurring routes (e.g., DA100 JFKâ†’SFO)

- **Flight_Operating_Days**: Operating days (Monday, Wednesday, etc.)

- **Flight_Avalibility**: Bookable instances with specific dates, aircraft, and pricing

## Pricing Structure
- **Base Price**
- **Class Surcharge** (Economy: $0, Business: +$50, First: +$100)
- **Booking Fee** (fixed per booking)

##Multi-Leg Journeys
- Round-trip bookings use composite keys in the Ticket table, allowing a single Booking_ID to contain multiple flight segments.
